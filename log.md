# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started Binary Search Explore card on Leetcode. I also started working on a project with Nupur.

**Thoughts** I am finding it very difficult to implement such a simple searching algorithm in some questions. I've planned to perfect. I had initially thought to master DP but a question got me to realize that I do not even know Binary Search all that well. That question is Longest Increasing Subsequenct. Easily done in n^2, but nlogn is the real deal. Anyway Imma work on that.

### Day 2: May 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I continued facing troubles in Binary Search. I partially solved two questions on codechef may long challenge. Added the landing page developed by Nupur to my backend structure. 

**Thoughts** Binary Search is turning out to be an annoyance. I have made a resolution that I shall will surely master it.

### Day 5: May 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Binary Search on leetcode. I'll try to attempt more questions of Binary Search on interviewbit. I implemented Authentication using email and password with firebase on Collaborate (our project name). 

**Thoughts** I feel like I'm still not proficient with Binary Search. Oh damn this.

### Day 6: May 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I did a few questions on InterviewBit on Binary Search. Didn't work on the web project today. I also continued the Stacks and Queues explore template which I had left to complete Binary Search. I had completed Queues and before and I completed Stacks today. A couple of difficult of stacks remain.

**Thoughts** I wasted a lot of time watching ACM ICPC Finals streams. 

### Day 7: May 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I felt shocked when I couldn't solve the Coin Change Problem on Hackerrank. Then I realized that it was a different variation of what I had solved earlier on Leetcode. Talking about leetcode, I couldn't solve today's May Leetcoding Challenge question, probably because I didn't spend as much time. It is some sort of sliding window algorithm which I will checkout tomorrow. My friend introduced me to CSES. I did 8 questions of Dynamic Programming in it. Interestingly, there were three variations of the Coin Change problem in the problem set. One was similar to Leetcode's, the second one was what I couldn't solve at Hackerrank earlier that morning, and the third one which was actually the question of the solution of what I had thought would work for the second one. And more interstingly, I still couldn't solve the second one.

**Thoughts** I love CSES.

### Day 8: May 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I was stuck in a sliding window problem of Leetcode. Still not versed with this. I think I'll take this up as my next endeavour. Also, I solved 4 questions on Codeforces Div 3, my highest yet. So yay! I have started Angular today. Just the introduction as the power was out. 

**Thoughts** Imma be a cool MEAN Stack developer. For that Imma perfect Angular. So Imma do that. Oh yeah.
