# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started Binary Search Explore card on Leetcode. I also started working on a project with Nupur.

**Thoughts** I am finding it very difficult to implement such a simple searching algorithm in some questions. I've planned to perfect. I had initially thought to master DP but a question got me to realize that I do not even know Binary Search all that well. That question is Longest Increasing Subsequenct. Easily done in n^2, but nlogn is the real deal. Anyway Imma work on that.

### Day 2: May 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I continued facing troubles in Binary Search. I partially solved two questions on codechef may long challenge. Added the landing page developed by Nupur to my backend structure. 

**Thoughts** Binary Search is turning out to be an annoyance. I have made a resolution that I shall will surely master it.

### Day 5: May 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed Binary Search on leetcode. I'll try to attempt more questions of Binary Search on interviewbit. I implemented Authentication using email and password with firebase on Collaborate (our project name). 

**Thoughts** I feel like I'm still not proficient with Binary Search. Oh damn this.
